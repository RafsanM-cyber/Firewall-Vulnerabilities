         Among the attraction of all the hardware, Firewalls is a big one to consider. If you don't know 
         what a firewall is, it is basically a device that controls internet traffic to prevent unauthorized access of a certain network. 
         Of course with a network secure, the security providing this network security has to be maitained, 
         orelse attackers will breach into it. There are various problems with firewalls, and one specefically, 
         used by a bunch of companies, Fortinet's FortiGate, a modern firewall that aims to provides comprehensive security over 
         internet traffic over a network. This 'comprehensive security' will be covered more in the Product webpage.
