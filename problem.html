        <h1>The Problem with Fortinet FortiGate</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="fire">
         <p>Various problems can be seen in Fortinet's Fortigate, like problem actually securing 
            encryption keys used to encrypt messages, lack of signature detection so even when a attack is done, details cannot 
            be retreived that easily with a lack of signature detection, and much more. if these fall into a hacker it is game over. Therefore,
            we will provide a comprehensive solution to this problem and be giving reasons to why and how this will work

        <div class="encryption">
             <p>Fortinet's FortiGate handles ALL internet traffic across an assigned network,
                and oftentimes sensitive info is passed along through this firewall. This Sensitive info is exposed in 
            the plain software, so attacks like side-channel attack and brute-force decryption can happen. To combat this issue, 
         adding a dedicated HSM(Hardware Security Module) will help prevent exposure of these sensitive keys and prevent this sensitive info to reach the hands of malicious actors. </p>

             <h3>Problems with Signature-Based Detection</h3>

        <div class="De">
            <p>Signature-Based Detection identifies threats by comparing incoming-data to database of a known threat signature. So compares the direct data with the threat to the data with an indirect threat. 
                This method has significant limitations, and does horrible against zero-day exploits, when the problem is unidentifiable. 
            To combat this, the use of AI powered chips like NVIDIA BlueField DPUs or Intel Tofino smartNIC's can be used to analyze network traffic using Machine Learning. This monitors 
        the network traffic at ALL times and whenever an anomalous behavior is detected, AI takes immediate action. This resolves the zero-day exploit problem and ensures secure traffic in the long run.</p>

        <div class="Tam">
            <p>Fortinet's Fortigate suffers with DPI(Deep Packet Inspection) with it slowing under heavy loads. 
                This significantly tampers around with network speeds, slowing 
                down the network. To tackle this, adding FPGA accelerators like Intel Stratix or XUP-VVH Accelerator Cards will speed up DPI and tamper much less with network speeds.   </p>
